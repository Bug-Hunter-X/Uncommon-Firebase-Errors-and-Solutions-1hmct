The solution usually involves reviewing your Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore security rules to ensure they allow the intended access.  Carefully examine your data to make sure you are using the correct data types and structures.  For asynchronous operations, use appropriate promise handling techniques (`.then()`, `.catch()`) or async/await to ensure proper error handling and to avoid race conditions.  Debugging tools such as the Firebase console and browser's developer tools can be helpful in identifying the root cause.
