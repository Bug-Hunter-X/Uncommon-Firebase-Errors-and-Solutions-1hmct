The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the rules in your Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore are not configured correctly.  For example, if your rules are too restrictive, you might get a permission denied error when trying to read or write data.  Another common issue is improperly structured data that doesn't match the data types you're expecting.  This can cause unexpected behavior or errors.  Sometimes, you might encounter errors when using asynchronous operations incorrectly, particularly with promises or async/await.
